# Pierre
A mod for Broken Dreams Correctional Center. Introduces Pierre (name will be changed later on for compatibility reasons) and his harem of sl- pets.

# Why?
So many reasons. 
- I wanted to try myself at modding. 
- I wanted to make some content for subby players like myself. 
- I wanted to see if content I write can still have effect on myself (I doubt lol).
- I wanted to express my own sexuality in a way.
- I want the mod to be a little statement and action behind my words of supporting sex-positivity by contributing something sexual and being public about it (like on my website, also, this is not to say that the mod is for myself, even though in part it is)

Majority of this mod's content has been written without too much thought put into it, on fly and on sheer impulse. I'm certainly far from award winning story writer, but I tried my best, only you can judge how good of a job I've done.

# Goals
## Mod's audience
Mod is directed pretty much exclusively at players who are submissive. In game there are already a bunch of ways the player can effectively submit to other creatures - recentlishly added hypnokink is a great example of that, Tavi's questline also has a route/revolves around player submitting to Tavi as their pet. Those things are wonderful and I love them, but in-game slave system is definitely directed at dominant players. This mod tries to address that by adding a character that can enslave the player.

## Slavery
I think there is a reason why there are dozens of harem-management games where player becomes harem's owner and manages slave instead of being one. I think in large part there isn't much of a way to make the player be a slave and keep the gameplay entertaining. If becoming a slave means less choice - the game may become boring. 

## Base game
The goal is to create a mod with as little of overwriting the core modules to preserve compatibility and not have a dance every time base game gets an update. This means that we'll try to use as many of mechanics that already exist in the game.

# Contributing
Anyone is encouraged to contribute! If you think you have a good idea the issue tracker is there, I welcome pull requests, if you are unsure whether what you like would fit the mod feel free to join a discussion, I don't bite and no kink grosses me out really *wink wink*!

# Usage
I also license the mod on the same license base game is licensed on, it's a nod both to game's developer who I insanely respect for creating such a big, organized, **open-source**, kinky project. I give my permission to use any part if not the entirety in other projects, including base game if one so desires. If you want to be extra sure you use my work in a way that I'd be alright with, you can also look at my [acceptable use policy for my fursona character](https://frisk.space/about/fursona-use/#specific-terms), even though my fursona is not part of the mod, the terms described in there are generally applicable, even if not enforceable. Of course, if you use my work, please credit my name appropriately.

# Credits
Making games is a lot of work. This entire mod has taken me days worth of hours just to get to 1.0. And it's just a single mod. Rahi (Broken Dreams Correctional Center creator) has done enormous work on making a base game to build off. They have dedicated time and effort to create tools that allow others to make the additional content (this is a rarity! I want to see more of such projects, lets build kinky stuff together, open your kink games everyone!). 

One does not simply make a kinky lewd game of this caliber in a single month.
Thus, Rahi deserves a big chunk of the credit. While working on scenes, and other things I've used their existing work to make my own. It goes without saying that without BDCC, this mod wouldn't exist. So I'm grateful for their commitment and time. While I wish they were a bit more engaged at least on GitHub repo itself, I claim no expectations in that regard, they are free to have any amount of commitment they want.

So at the end, if you like what I did, consider [supporting Rahi on Subscribestar](https://subscribestar.adult/rahi).
