# Issix
A mod for Broken Dreams Correctional Center. Introduces Issix and his harem of s[l](https://kenashcorp.bandcamp.com/track/im-your-slave)- pets.

## Disclaimer
The mod and contents in it is - surprise surprise - a work of fiction. Author does not support, condone, advocate for, endorse, stand up for non-consensual activities, relationships or violence.

# Existing content
**This mod currently makes assumptions about a player - mainly that they are playing an anthropomorphic animal character, if this makes you uncomfortable, you are discouraged from playing it. It might be alleviated in the future**
- Issix - a dragon-demon hybrid, he owns 3 pets, all of them have some story that you can uncover (and which may be expanded in the future)
 - Azazel - a kind feline breeding bitch
 - Hiisi - a troubled pup - guardian angel of the harem (after Issix)
 - Lamia - a mute and sexually absent fox
- One quest that leads to your enslavement by Issix (currently only implemented voluntary enslavement as a pet, this is an overall rather "nice" type of enslavement), there are a bunch of fun elements in it, like figuring out an ASCII map or filling a questionnaire
- Each pet has their own mechanic that increases their trust/affection towards the player
- Finally, voluntary enslavement, if you eventually get enslaved it may make your game a bit more difficult
- Some branches of choices and situations.
- Hopefully at least around an hour of additional gameplay? Haven't tested yet, but the fact is, I counted more than 43k words in saynn (dialogues) is quite a bit. Not every part of what player sees is even in saynn, which makes the size of this mod way more than I anticipated.

What isn't there is basically a lot of post-enslavement content. This is major focus of current work on the mod for it to grow to 1.0 release.

In tags: M/player, M/M (implied), petplay, slave, corruption (of PC), watersports, parasite

# Goals
## Mod's audience
Mod is directed pretty much exclusively at players who are submissive. In game there are already a bunch of ways the player can effectively submit to other creatures - recentlishly added hypnokink is a great example of that, Tavi's questline also has a route/revolves around player submitting to Tavi as their pet. Those things are wonderful and I love them, but in-game slave system is definitely directed at dominant players. This mod tries to address that by adding a character that can enslave **the player**. It features degradation, pet-play content, watersports (for those who switch it on), branding. In addition - worth noting that the entire harem of pets is male.

What you **shouldn't expect** from the mod at the moment is for it to be heavy on non-con or roughness. While the "non-con non-con" (instead of current voluntary non-con) is one of the ideas I have, it is planned to be implemented at later time if I have enough motivation. It should feature both a way to get enslaved by Issix forcefully as well as be an option when advancing slavery in Issix's harem so anyone can get some non-con action. In fact, current content for many could even be seen as not slavery related enough with it being so easy on player, I'm open to feedback.

## Slavery
I think there is a reason why there are dozens of harem-management games where player becomes harem's owner and manages slave instead of being one. I think in large part there isn't much of a way to make the player be a slave and keep the gameplay entertaining. If becoming a slave means less choice - the game may become boring. In this mod I'm trying my best to still feel like player is enslaved while at the same time let them continue playing the game with full functionality. This is not an easy task to do, but probably better than eternity of being stuck in one time playing card game with another pet.

## Planned content
Mod is driven by BDCC players [giving](https://github.com/Friskygote/Issix-mod/discussions) mod's author headpats and calling him a good boy, without those author might run out of motivation ;)    
Here is a list of planned content:    
- Some parasite related content (already foreshadowed)
- Expanded slavery scenes/systems
- Alternative route of enslavement for players who are the type of people that completes Undertale's genocide run 5 times just for fun *stares with judgement*
- More Issix/pet related scenes around the prison
- Issix's mechanic of dealing in BDSM restraints
- A "last choice" reward, making the game harder and more annoying by stripping player's choices completely in relation to some slave related mechanics
- Making use of existing system to improve affection with pets
  - Including ability to make love with Hiisi and Azazel

I'm currently undecided whether to prioritize alternative route of enslavement/improvement of existing content/prostitute role or non-con role. If you have good arguments for any, feel free to let me know!
  
## Technical stuff
The goal is to create a mod with as little of overwriting the core modules to preserve compatibility and not have a dance every time base game gets an update. This means that we'll try to use as many of mechanics that already exist in the game as possible. Granted, while I'm a coder, I'm unsure I can properly implement complex system in Godot, so I might need some help with that.

# Contributing
Anyone is encouraged to contribute! If you think you have a good idea the issue tracker is there, I welcome pull requests, if you are unsure whether what you like would fit the mod feel free to join a discussion, I don't bite and no kink grosses me out really *wink wink*!

Please however, do not use generative AI to contribute to the project. None of the work in here has been generated by gen AI and I'd like to keep it this way. Thank you!

# Usage
I also license the mod on the same license base game is licensed on, it's a nod both to game's developer who I insanely respect for creating such a big, organized, **open-source**, kinky project. I give my permission to use any part if not the entirety in other projects, including base game if one so desires. If you want to be extra sure you use my work in a way that I'd be alright with, you can also look at my [acceptable use policy for my fursona character](https://frisk.space/about/fursona-use/#specific-terms), even though my fursona is not part of the mod, the terms described in there are generally applicable, even if not enforceable. Of course, if you use my work, please credit my name appropriately.

# Why?
So many reasons. 
- I wanted to try myself at modding. 
- I wanted to make some content for subby players like myself. 
- I wanted to see if content I write can still have effect on myself (I doubt lol, (EDIT: knowing the material successfully makes me immune to horny)).
- I wanted to express my own sexuality in a way.
- I want the mod to be a little statement and action behind my words of supporting sex-positivity by contributing something sexual and being public about it (like on my website, also, this is not to say that the mod is for myself, even though in part it is)
- I wanted to make a statement. I'm writing this mod in times where certain awful people gain power over incredibly powerful state in the world, their policies represent oppression against creatures. So in part, this mod is part of my advocacy for sex-positivity as well as acceptance of LGBT+ creatures, and therefore a political statement.

Majority of this mod's content has been written without too much thought put into it, on fly and on sheer impulse. I'm certainly far from award winning story writer, but I tried my best, only you can judge how good of a job I've done.

# Credits
Making games is a lot of work. This entire mod has taken me days worth of hours just to get to 1.0. And it's just a single mod. Rahi (Broken Dreams Correctional Center creator) has done enormous work on making a base game to build off. They have dedicated time and effort to create tools that allow others to make the additional content (this is a rarity! I want to see more of such projects, lets build kinky stuff together, open your kink games everyone!). 

One does not simply make a kinky lewd game of this caliber in a single month.
Thus, Rahi deserves a big chunk of the credit. While working on scenes, and other things I've used their existing work to make my own. It goes without saying that without BDCC, this mod wouldn't exist. So I'm grateful for their commitment and time. While I wish they were a bit more engaged at least on GitHub repo itself, I claim no expectations in that regard, they are free to have any amount of commitment they want.

So at the end, if you like what I did, consider [supporting Rahi on Subscribestar](https://subscribestar.adult/rahi).

# Alternatives
During development of this modification Katz released their own „Dragon Slave” datapack which has similar goal of adding another Master with ability to enslave the player character. You may want to check that one out as well :)
