# Pierre
A mod for Broken Dreams Correctional Center. Introduces Pierre (name will be changed later on for compatibility reasons) and his harem of sl- pets.

# Why?
So many reasons. 
- I wanted to try myself at modding. 
- I wanted to make some content for subby players like myself. 
- I wanted to see if content I write can still have effect on myself (I doubt lol).
- I wanted to express my own sexuality in a way.
- I want the mod to be a little statement and action behind my words of supporting sex-positivity by contributing something sexual and being public about it (like on my website, also, this is not to say that the mod is for myself, even though in part it is)

Majority of this mod's content has been written without too much thought put into it, on fly and on sheer impulse. I'm certainly far from award winning story writer, but I tried my best, only you can judge how good of a job I've done.

# Goals
## Mod's audience
Mod is directed pretty much exclusively at players who are submissive. In game there are already a bunch of ways the player can effectively submit to other creatures - recentlishly added hypnokink is a great example of that, Tavi's questline also has a route/revolves around player submitting to Tavi as their pet. Those things are wonderful and I love them, but in-game slave system is definitely directed at dominant players. This mod tries to address that by adding a character that can enslave the player.

## Slavery
I think there is a reason why there are dozens of harem-management games where player becomes harem's owner and manages slave instead of being one. I think in large part there isn't much of a way to make the player be a slave and keep the gameplay entertaining. If becoming a slave means less choice - the game may become boring. 

## Base game
The goal is to create a mod with as little of overwriting the core modules to preserve compatibility and not have a dance every time base game gets an update. This means that we'll try to use as many of mechanics that already exist in the game.

# Contributing
Anyone is encouraged to contribute! If you think you have a good idea the issue tracker is there, I welcome pull requests and I hope together we can polish them to become part of the mod if there are any concerns.

I also license the mod on the same license base game is licensed on, it's a nod both to game's developer who I insanely respect for creating such a big, organized, **open-source**, kinky project
