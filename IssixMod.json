    "description": "Tags: M/player, M/M (implied), petplay, slavery, degradation, watersports (in-game toggle content), parasite (future, opt-in)\n\nIssix is a demonic dragon sick entirely of the world around, finding peace in BDCC facility. His idea of paradise is to own slaves to keep him company, do YOU want to join them?\n\nIssix mod adds 4 characters to the game - Issix as a dominant demonic dragon as well as Azazel, Hiisi and Lamia - his loyal pets. Mod is directed at players who when playing video games prefer to put themselves in submissive roles, as its the player who can join Issix's harem as one of his pets.\n\nCurrent features:\n* 4 characters, all with some interactions coded in, you can help Lamia categorize their artwork, get some drugs for Azazel and play Rock Paper Scissor with Hiisi\n* 17 scenes, sort of meaningless number, but likely enough of content for at least an hour of gameplay with plans for expansion in the future\n* 1 quest leading to player's voluntary enslavement by Issix\n\nPlanned content:\n* More content after player is enslaved which is currently missing\n* Prostitute role\n* \"Hard mode\" with less choice and total submission to Master\n* Alternative route leading to enslavement\n* Expansion of content for all characters\n\nEveryone is welcome to contribute to the mod over on GitHub at https://github.com/Friskygote/Issix-mod.",
